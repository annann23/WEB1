    <br>The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)
    <br>is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids,and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.
    <br>The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,
    <br>which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated,
    <br>and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
